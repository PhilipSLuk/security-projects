Hi, I'm Bushy Evergreen.

I'm glad you're here, I'm the target of a terrible trick.

Pepper says his editor is the best, but I don't understand why.

He's forcing me to learn vi.

He gave me a link, I'm supposed to learn the basics.

Can you assist me with one of the simple cases?

I'm in quite a fix, I need a quick escape.
Pepper is quite pleased, while I watch here, agape.
Her editor's confusing, though "best" she says - she yells!
My lesson one and your role is exit back to shellz.
-Bushy Evergreen

Wow, it seems so easy now that you've shown me how!

To thank you, I'd like to share some other tips with you.

Have you taken a look at the Orientation Challenge?

This challenge is limited to past SANS Holiday Hack Challenges from 2015, 2016, and 2017. You DO NOT need to play those challenges.

If you listen closely to Ed Skoudis' talk at the con, you might even pick up all the answers you need...

It may take a little poking around, but with your skills, I'm sure it'll be a wintergreen breeze!
