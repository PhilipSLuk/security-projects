### NAME OF THE MACHINE AS A HINT?

Since this is a `Windows` box, perhaps this is in reference to the recent
`ETERNALBLUE` exploit?

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue

EternalBlue, sometimes stylized as ETERNALBLUE, is an exploit developed by the
U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) according to testimony by former NSA
employees. It was leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacker group on April 14, 2017,
and was used as part of the worldwide WannaCry ransomware attack on May 12,
2017. The exploit was also used to help carry out the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack
on June 27, 2017 and reported to be used as part of the Retefe banking trojan
since at least September 5, 2017.

EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft's implementation of the Server
Message Block (SMB) protocol. This vulnerability is denoted by entry
CVE-2017-0144 in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) catalog. The
vulnerability exists because the SMB version 1 (SMBv1) server in various
versions of Microsoft Windows mishandles specially crafted packets from remote
attackers, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the target computer.
```

### PORTSCANNING w/ NMAP

Use `nmap` to see if we can detect what services our host is offering, what
operating system (and version) our host is running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, etc.

```
$ sudo nmap -A -sS -T4 10.10.10.40 > nmap.out
Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-12-21 17:44 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.40
Host is up (0.39s latency).
Not shown: 991 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE      VERSION
135/tcp   open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn  Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
49152/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
49153/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
49154/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
49155/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
49156/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
49157/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
No exact OS matches for host (If you know what OS is running on it, see https://nmap.org/submit/ ).
```

So we have 3 open service running - msrpc(135,49152-49157), netbios-ssn(139),
microsoft-ds(445). Host OS is Windows 7 Profession 7601 Service Pack 1. 

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block

Since Windows 2000, SMB runs, by default, with a thin layer, similar to the
Session Message packet of NBT's Session Service, on top of TCP, using TCP port
445 rather than TCP port 139â€”a feature known as "direct host SMB".
```

So the microsoft-ds(445) service suddenly pops out as being interesting with
its tie in to the ETERNALBLUE exploit.

### MS17_010_ETERNALBLUE

Googling around for a metasploit package to exploit the ETERNALBLUE
vulnerability leads us to this one..

```
https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

MS17-010 EternalBlue SMB Remote Windows Kernel Pool Corruption

This module is a port of the Equation Group ETERNALBLUE exploit, part of the
FuzzBunch toolkit released by Shadow Brokers. There is a buffer overflow
memmove operation in Srv!SrvOs2FeaToNt. The size is calculated in
Srv!SrvOs2FeaListSizeToNt, with mathematical error where a DWORD is subtracted
into a WORD. The kernel pool is groomed so that overflow is well laid-out to
overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. Actual RIP hijack is later completed in
srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete. This exploit, like the original may not
trigger 100% of the time, and should be run continuously until triggered. It
seems like the pool will get hot streaks and need a cool down period before the
shells rain in again. The module will attempt to use Anonymous login, by
default, to authenticate to perform the exploit. If the user supplies
credentials in the SMBUser, SMBPass, and SMBDomain options it will use those
instead. On some systems, this module may cause system instability and crashes,
such as a BSOD or a reboot. This may be more likely with some payloads.
```

So let's give it a try!
