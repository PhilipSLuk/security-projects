### ERROR LEVEL ANALYSIS (ELA)

```
Error Level Analysis (ELA) permits identifying areas within an image that are at
different compression levels. With JPEG images, the entire picture should be at
roughly the same level. If a section of the image is at a significantly different
error level, then it likely indicates a digital modification.
```

Performing ELA analysis on the PNG file shows some anomolies in the black banner
at the bottom of the image.

### INCREASING EXPOSURE

Increasing the photo's exposure allows us to clearly read the hidden text within
the black banner!
