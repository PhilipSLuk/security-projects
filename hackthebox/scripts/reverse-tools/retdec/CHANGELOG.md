* New Feature: Added generation of export-table hashes into `retdec-fileinfo` ([#121](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/121), [#321](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/pull/321)).
* New Feature: Automatically generate and publicly host an up-to-date Doxygen documentation ([#20](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/20)).
* Enhancement: Suppress superfluous randlib warnings about static libraries having no symbols on macOS ([#271](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/271), [#349](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/pull/349)).
* Fix: Fixed assertions in statically linked code recognition ([#333](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/333)).

# v3.1 (2018-06-07)

* New Feature: `retdec-fileinfo` is now able to detect when a PE file is corrupted and cannot be loaded ([#281](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/pull/281)).
* New Feature: Added a new tool: `retdec-getsig`. It can be used for creating signatures of packers, compilers, and other tools.
* New Feature: The number of bytes read from the input file's entry point by `retdec-fileinfo` is now configurable with the `--ep-bytes` option.
* Enhancement: Complete rewrite of binary to LLVM IR decoding phase ([#116](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/116)).
* Enhancement: Added reference checks to statically linked code detection ([#113](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/113)).
* Enhancement: Speeded up RetDec rebuild and installation by disabling forced reconfiguration of LLVM ([#294](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/pull/294)).
* Enhancement: Added new OS/ABI and tool detections for ELF files ([#244](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/244)).
* Enhancement: Improved support for analysis of ELF [core files](http://www.gabriel.urdhr.fr/2015/05/29/core-file/) by `retdec-fileinfo` ([#142](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/142)).
* Enhancement: Added support for limiting overall memory when running decompilations and tools ([#270](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/270), [#290](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/290)). By default, decompilations are now run with limited memory (half of system RAM) to prevent "black screens" (mostly on Windows). Use `--no-memory-limit` to override.
* Enhancement: On macOS, you no longer need to have GNU coreutils in `PATH` to build and install RetDec. GNU coreutils are still needed to run RetDec, though.
* Enhancement: Import-table hashes generated by `retdec-fileinfo` are now compatible with import-table hashes from YARA/pefile ([#246](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/246)).
* Enhancement: Tool `retdec-macho-extractor` can now extract objects from non-archive Mach-O universal binaries ([#125](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/125)).
* Enhancement: References to ticket numbers from our internal issue tracking system were replaced by short descriptions in the `retdec-regression-tests` repository ([retdec-regression-tests #1](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-regression-tests/issues/1)).
* Enhancement: Added a missing license for the `retdec-support` repository ([retdec-support #1](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-support/issues/1)).
* Enhancement: Better detection of tools: new signatures and heuristics. YARA signatures are compiled now.
* Enhancement: Added Travis and AppVeyor continuous integration builds ([#2](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/2)).
* Enhancement: Build with `-std=c++14` instead of `-std=gnu++14` with GCC on Linux ([#76](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/76)).
* Enhancement: Speeded up build by skipping compilation of unnecessary dependencies (e.g. unused LLVM libraries, tools, and examples).
* Enhancement: OpenSSL is now automatically built only if it is not found in your system.
* Enhancement: Added support for a system-wide installation ([#94](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/94)).
* Enhancement: Prefixed all the installed binaries and scripts with `retdec-` ([#70](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/70)). Also, some tools were renamed to make their names more uniform.
* Enhancement: Got rid of all git submodules ([#92](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/92), [#93](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/93)). Moved sources of all RetDec-related repositories to this main repository. Third-party dependencies are downloaded and built via CMake's external projects. This allows us to have e.g. only a single copy of LLVM ([#14](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/14)) and not require a recursive clone ([#48](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/48), [#68](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/68), [#72](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/72)).
* Enhancement: Set a proper `rpath` during installation on Linux and macOS ([#77](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/77), [#100](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/100)). This allows us to move the installation directory after the installation into another location.
* Enhancement: Added community support for building and running RetDec inside Docker ([#60](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/pull/60)).
* Enhancement: Decrease the default timeout when downloading the support package during installation ([#6](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/pull/6)).
* Enhancement: Any shell can be used to install the decompiler, not just Bash.
* Enhancement: Added unofficial support for macOS build ([#7](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/7)).
* Enhancement: Allow 32b versions of `bin2llvmir` and `llvmir2hll` on Windows access more memory ([#7](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/73)).
* Enhancement: Added a method in `loader::Image` to obtain segment content as a raw data pointer.
* Enhancement: `retdec-fileinfo` now prints raw bytes of Rich Header in the JSON format ([#288](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/288)).
* Enhancement: Delayed imports in PE files are now distinguished from non-delayed imports in the output from `retdec-fileinfo` by a boolean flag ([#287](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/288)).
* Fix: Add a missing `.c` extension to files generated by `retdec-archive-decompiler.sh` ([#261](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/261).
* Fix: Fixed build of yaracpp on 32b Unix-like operating systems ([#299](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/299)).
* Fix: Fixed parsing of PE files having corrupted import tables ([#101](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/101)).
* Fix: Fixed parsing of delayed imports by ordinals in PE files ([#282](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/282)).
* Fix: Fixed ordering of detected tools (e.g. compilers and packers) on systems whose `std::sort()` is not stable ([#262](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/262)).
* Fix: When running RetDec on macOS, `gtimeout` is now used instead of `timeout` ([#260](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/260)). This fixes the following runtime error when running `retdec-archive-decompiler.sh`: `The `timeout` command is required but it is not available`.
* Fix: When running RetDec on macOS, `greadlink` is now used instead of `readlink`. This fixes runtime errors of the form `readlink: illegal option -- e`.
* Fix: `retdec-decompiler.sh` on macOS no longer requires the GNU version of `sed` ([#257](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/257)).
* Fix: `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is now used instead of `#!/bin/bash` to run our scripts ([#258](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/258)).
* Fix: Fixed `retdec-fileinfo` crashes when verifying digital signature of PE files ([#87](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/87)).
* Fix: Fixed infinite loop in COFF word length detection for rare cases ([#242](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/242)).
* Fix: Fixed several ELF bugs causing crashes ([#239](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/239), [#240](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/240), [#241](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/241), [#248](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/248)).

* Fix: Non-printable characters in ELF .dynamic section output are now replaced with hexadecimal codes ([#82](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/82)).
* Fix: Fix for several segmentation faults in ELF parsing module ([#89](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/89)).
* Fix: Added a workaround for a GCC 5 compilation bug ([#231](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/231)).
* Fix: Fix LLVM (and therefore RetDec) build on systems with architecture other than x86 ([llvm #3](https://github.com/avast-tl/llvm/issues/3)).
* Fix: Valid Mach-O x64 relocations are no longer ignored.
* Fix: Only a single copy of LLVM (and all other components) is kept ([#14](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/14)).
* Fix: RetDec works even if it is installed to a directory which have whitespaces in its path.
* Fix: Reduced the length of build paths to external projects ([#61](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/61)).

* Fix: Remove duplicate `lib` prefix when installing [libdwarf](https://github.com/avast-tl/libdwarf) libraries ([#31](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/31)).
* Fix: When installing the decompiler, do not remove the entire `share` directory ([#12](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/12)).
* Fix: Improve OS type detection when installing the decompiler.
* Fix: Remove useless OS type detection when running decompilations ([#10](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/10)).
* Fix: Filesystem path in utils now returns correct information when it is appended with another path.
