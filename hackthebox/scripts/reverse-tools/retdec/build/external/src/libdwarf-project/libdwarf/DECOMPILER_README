#  What was done to libdwarf:
#

In file libdwarf/libdwarfdefs.h:
	typedef of  __int32_t   renamed to  Dwarf__int32_t
	typedef of  __uint32_t  renamed to  Dwarf__uint32_t
	typedef of  __int64_t   renamed to  Dwarf__int64_t
	typedef of  __uint64_t  renamed to  Dwarf__uint64_t
==> affected files: dwarf_base_types.h, pro_opaque

In file dwarfdump2/globals.h:
	typedef of  __int32_t   renamed to  Dwarfdump2__int32_t
	typedef of  __uint32_t  renamed to  Dwarfdump2__uint32_t
	typedef of  __int64_t   renamed to  Dwarfdump2__int64_t
	typedef of  __uint64_t  renamed to  Dwarfdump2__uint64_t
==> affected files: print_die.cc, print_frames.cc

All these occurrences were renamed, because they colide with system getopt library on windows:
	opterr -> libdwarf_opterr
	optind -> libdwarf_optind
	optopt -> libdwarf_optopt

#  How to migrate to new version:
#

1.
Save old config.h and .make.mki files from all libdwarf parts that were built.

2.
Replace libdwarf with new version.

3.
Make libdwarf and other parts (dwarfump2, ...) with original Makefile.
This will build config.h and generate some sources that are needed for our build.

4.
Replace config.h files with original ones. Or at least check differences if making some changes.

5.
Add our .make.mki files. Make sure they contain all needed source files - some might be new in new release.
Make sure used sources do not have multiple main() functions - there might be multiple programs, do not
compile them together.

6.
Try to build it all.

#  How to add bin-interface to dwarfdump2, ...
#

1.
bin-interface sources are in libdwarf/bin-interface/.
Use them in all appplications, do not make separate copies - only one place to maintan/fix.

2.
To add bin-interface support to dwarfdump2 see libdwarf/bin-interface/dwarfdump.add.

3.
Add sources in libdwarf/bin-interface/ to other sources of the compiled application.
I tried to create library from bin-interface and use it in dwarfdump2, but the same code
that worked when compiled with other dwarfdump2 sources started to cause seg faults.
