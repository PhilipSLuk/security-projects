2015-05-01  David Anderson
     * dwarf.h: Added  DW_DEFAULTED* and DW_IDX* DWARF5 macros.
     * dwarf_abbrev.c: Expanded comments about the interface
       used by dwarfdump -a.
       It is NOT guaranteed to work on all objects.
       It continues to work usefully on a plain .o .
     * dwarf_alloc.h: Added code to clean when there
       are fission package file sections .debug_cu_index or
       .debug_tu_index.
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Significant changes to internals to support
       DWARF5 debug fission dwp package objects.
       Added dwarf_die_from_hash_signature() which lets one
       find DWP DIE information from a hash signature.
     * dwarf_error.c: Fifteen new DW_DLE* error messages added related
       to new DWARF5 sections and to debug fission package files.
     * dwarf_form.c:  New commentary about offsets rrelated to
       DWP package files.  New interface dwarf_formsig8_const()
       to read the DW_FORM_data8  a DW_AT_dwo_id uses.
     * dwarf_global.c: Added commentary about an old interface
       and DWARF5 (the old interface does not support DWARF5,
       newer (but not new) interfaces do).
     * dwarf_incl.h: Add dwarf_xu_index.h include.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Removed a couple dwo-section
       readers (they were not real) Added new DWARF5
       section readers and the appropriate .dwo section readers.
     * dwarf_line.c,dwarf_loc.c: Added support for getting the correct  line
     * dwarf_macro.c: Added comment that .debug_macinfo 
       section not supported in DWP
       Package File (and .debug_macinfo is not in DWARF5).
       section offset in a DWP package file.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Many New fields for the new sections
       and DWP Package File support.
       Various new functions (libdwarf internal) for the
       new sections.
     * dwarf_query.c: Added support for DWP Package File offsets.
     * dwarf_tsearch.h: Added ifndef DWARF_TSEARCH so #include
       more than once does not lead to difficulty.
     * dwarf_util.c:  Added support for DWP Package File data.
     * dwarf_xu_index.c: Added support for DWP Package File data
       so it can all be read properly.
     * dwarf_xu_index.h: Added ifndef DWARF_XU_INDEX_H so #include
       more than once does not lead to difficulty.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Added dwarf_get_IDX_name() and 
       dwarf_get_IDX_name(). Added fifteen new DW_DLE error codes.
       New function dwarf_die_from_hash_signature().
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Rev 2.27. Documented interfaces 
       dwarf_next_cu_header_d(),dwarf_die_from_hash_signature(),
       dwarf_get_debugfission_for_die(),dwarf_get_debugfission_for_key().
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
2015-04-23  David Anderson
     * dwarf.h: Delete spurious blank lines.
     * dwarf_base_types.h:  New defines. DW_CIE_VERSION* DW_CU_VERSION**
       DW_ARANGES_VERSION* DW_LINE_VERSION* DW_LOC_VERSION*
       DW_LINE_STR_VERSION5, DW_MACRO_VERSION5,
       DW_LINE_LOC, DW_NAMES_VERSION5, DW_PUBNAMES_VERSION*,
       DW_PUBTYPES_VERSION*, DW_STR_OFFSETS_VERSION5,
       DW_SUP_VERSION*, DW_CU_INDEX_VERSION5,
       DW_TU_INDEX_VERSION5, making version comparisons
       more precise and including DWARF5.
     * dwarf_arange.c: CURRENT_VERSION_STAMP -> DW_ARANGES_VERSION2 
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c,dwarf_global.c,dwarf_line.c, : Use the new 
       DW_*_VERSION* version names.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Added to 3 comments.
     * dwarf_loc.c: Use the new DW_*_VERSION* version names.
       Use a local variable to simpify some comparisons
       for readability.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Update the comments about version numbers.
       Added new comments foreshadowing changes for DebugFission
       and DWP. REMOVE CURRENT_VERSION_STAMP* macros as they
       are no longer used.
2015-03-10  David Anderson
     * dwgetopt.c: Was mishandling options
       missing their required argument.
2015-03-09  David Anderson
    * dwgetopt.c: Fixed a bug in handling options.
      See dwarfdump build for testing code 
      and test runs for dwgetopt.c
2015-02-22  David Anderson
    * dwgetopt.h, dwgetopt.c: Copied from dwarfdump so
      libdwarf can compile without dwarfdump source present.
    * Makefile.in: Builds dwgetopt.o
    * gennames.c: Now uses dwgetopt.o
2015-02-12  David Anderson
    * dwarf_original_elf_init.c(dwarf_elf_init_file_ownership):
      When dwarf_elf_object_access_init() returns DW_DLV_ERROR
      the Dwarf_Error was not getting set. Now it is set.
2015-02-04  David Anderson
    * dwarf.h: Added new TAGs etc from DWARF5. Since DWARF5 is
      not a completed standard these new things could change.
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Refactored calculation of end_of CU
      to ensure uniformity.  Added checks to catch attempts
      to read past end and coredump (can happen when the DWARF is 
      erroneous). Notice when bogus attribute wraps memory
      so the next DIE would be at an earlier address in memory
      than the current die (DW_DLE_NEXT_DIE_LOW_ERROR).
    * dwarf_error.c: DW_DLE_NEXT_DIE_LOW_ERROR error code added.
    * dwarf_form.c: Added check to ensure we do not run off the
      end of the string section (.debug_str).
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Declare new internal
      function  _dwarf_calculate_section_end_ptr().
    * dwarf_query.c(dwarf_attrlist): 
      A little bit of refactoring/reordering done to catch
      errors.
      Created new function _dwarf_calculate_section_end_ptr().
    * dwarf_xu_index.c: Removed trailing space, one line..
    * libdwarf.h.in: Added define of DW_DLE_NEXT_DIE_LOW_ERROR.
2015-01-31  David Anderson
    * Makefile.in,common.c,common.h,dwarf_abbrev.c,dwarf_abbrev.h,
      dwarf_addr_finder.c,dwarf_alloc.c,dwarf_alloc.h,dwarf_arange.c,
      dwarf_arange.h,dwarf_base_types.h,dwarf_die_deliv.c,dwarf_die_deliv.h,
      dwarf_elf_access.c,dwarf_elf_access.h,dwarf_error.h,dwarf_form.c,
      dwarf_frame.c,dwarf_frame.h,dwarf_frame2.c,dwarf_frame3.c,dwarf_funcs.c,
      dwarf_funcs.h,dwarf_gdbindex.c,dwarf_global.c,dwarf_global.h,
      dwarf_incl.h,dwarf_leb.c,dwarf_line.c,dwarf_line.h,dwarf_line2.c,
      dwarf_loc.c,dwarf_loc.h,dwarf_macro.c,dwarf_macro.h,
      dwarf_opaque.h,dwarf_original_elf_init.c,dwarf_print_lines.c,
      dwarf_pubtypes.c,dwarf_query.c,dwarf_ranges.c,dwarf_reloc_arm.h:
      Removed obsolete postal address and oss.sgi.com address
      from copyright.

2015-01-30  David Anderson
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Now uses Dwarf_Sig8 for .debug_cu_index.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Use Dwarf_Sig8 for the dfp_hash field.
     * libdwarf.h.in: dwarf_get_xu_hash_entry() uses Dwarf_Sig8 now.
2015-01-30  David Anderson
     * dwarf.h: Adding some DWARF5 defines. 
       Use with caution: DWARF5 is not yet final.
     * gennames.c: Local array needed to be bigger
       due to a longer attribute list.
2015-01-28  David Anderson
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Fixed .H 2 to .H 3 on
       dwarf_get_TAG_name etc.
       Removed duplication of 3 lines of 
       Global Namespace operations.
       Added doc of dwarf_dwarf_get_debug_str_index()
       and fixed a level 2 header (starting the quoted
       string with a period caused trouble in the
       output).
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf. Regenerated. Version 2.25.
2015-01-25  David Anderson
     * dwarf_form.c(dwarf_convert_to_global_offset): Removed
       yesterday's change. The cu_context offset value
       already has debugfission offset built in.
2015-01-24  David Anderson
     * dwarf_form.c: dwarf_convert_to_global_offset() was not
       accounting for debugfission data (dwp).
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c(dwarf_offdie_b): Was not adding
       cc_extension_size into cu header offset (cc_extension_size
       is rarely non-zero, but its omission was a bug here).
     * dwarf_util.h: Improved a line of commentary.
2015-01-21  David Anderson
     * Makefile.in: Now with separate dwarf_names.h and dwarf_names.c
       rules so parallel make works properly.
     * dwarf.h: Improved the comment on DW_SECT_TYPES as that
       is not actually part of DWARF5 but is reserved.
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Added dwarf_get_debugfission_for_die().
       Now dwarfdump and other clients can access
       and print fission data for a specific CU easily.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c(load_debugfission_tables): Deleted 
       unused local variable.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Now uses libdwarf.h DW_FISSION_SECT_COUNT
       for clarity (libdwarf-only name).
     * libdwarf.h.in: Add DW_DLE_FISSION_VERSION_ERROR as part
       of error checking. Add prototype for 
       dwarf_get_debugfission_for_die() and declare its struct argument.
2015-01-18  David Anderson
     * dwarf_abbrev.c: Added comment, debugfission not supported
       in the non-cu-specific interface.
     * dwarf_alloc.c, dwarf_base_types.h: Add DW_DLA_FISSION_PERCU support.
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Added _dwarf_get_fission_addition_die()
       and  _dwarf_get_fission_addition() for debugfission support.
     * dwarf_error.c: Add DW_DLE_FISSION_INDEX_WRONG error string.
     * dwarf_form.c: Add debugfission support for str_offsets.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Load debugfission tables if such exist
       in an object.
     * dwarf_line.c: Add debugfission support for .debug_line.dwo
     * dwarf_loc.c: Add debugfission support for .debug_loc.dwo
     * dwarf_macro.c: Add comment that debugfission not supported
       in the non-CU-specific interface.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Add structures for debugfission:
       Dwarf_Fission_Offsets_s,Dwarf_Fission_Per_CU_s,
       Dwarf_Fission_Section_Offset_s.
       declare the new functions in dwarf_die_deliv.c
     * dwarf_util.c: Remove a few lines of traling whitespace.
     * dwarf_uxu_index.c: Correct bogus formatting.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Add DW_DLE_FISSION_INDEX_WRONG .
2015-01-12  David Anderson
     * dwarf_init_finish.c(_dwarf_setup): Move freeresult
       declaration before statements.
     * dwarf_util.c: Add comments about va_end().
2015-01-11  David Anderson
     * dwarf_init_finish.c(_dwarf_setup): For all returns 
       in _dwarf_setup() free the sections malloc space.
2015-01-08  David Anderson
     * cmplrs/dwarf_addr_finder.h: Fix a comment and remove a trailing
       whitespace.
     * dwarf.h: Blank line added accidentally.
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Remove trailing whitespace. Fix indent.
     * dwarf_leb.c: Remove trailing whitespace. Fix indent.
     * dwarf_line.h: Fix macro backslash location, lining things up.
     * dwarf_util.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
2015-01-06  David Anderson
     * 	dwarf_alloc.c, dwarf_base_types.h, dwarf_elf_access.c,
        dwarf_error.c,dwarf_error.h,dwarf_form.c,dwarf_init_finish.c,
        dwarf_leb.c,dwarf_query.c,pro_section.c: Fixed indents and
        removed trailing whitespace.
2015-01-06  David Anderson
     * dwarf_frame.c( _dwarf_get_fde_info_for_a_pc_row): Cast
       the pointer returned from _dwarf_get_alloc(), somehow
       this cast was omitted.
     * dwarf_alloc.c(dwarf_dealloc): Ensure a NULL
       'space' pointer input is not touched before checking
       if it is set.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c(_dwarf_setup): For badly formed Elf
       ensure we do not use stale pointers.
2015-01-05  David Anderson
     * dwarf_original_elf_init.c(dwarf_finish): If the Dwarf_Debug is
       not initialized do not use it.
2015-01-03  David Anderson
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Somehow dwarf_transform_to_disk_form()
       was not documented. Now it is.
     * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated, version 1.38.
2015-01-03  David Anderson
     * dwarf_allo.c: Comment the allocation table base
       more carefully.
     * dwarf_base_types.h: Making DW_DLA defines more
       readable, more consistent with other instances.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Adding producer error codes.
       The producer library has some places error values
       are misidentified. Main effect: documentation.
     * dwarf_error.c:  Add the strings for the new error codes.
2015-01-01  David Anderson
     *	A new year begins.
