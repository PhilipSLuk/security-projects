# TRYHACKME: ADVENTOFCYBER2 [DAY 22] BLUE TEAMING - Elf McEager becomes CyberElf

```
The past few days there have been strange things happening at Best Festival Company. McEager hasn't had the time to fully investigate the compromised endpoints with everything that is going on nor does he have the time to reimage the workstations. McEager decides to log into a different workstation, one of his backup systems.

McEager logs in and to his dismay he can't log into his password manager. It's not accepting his master key! He notices that the folder name has been renamed to something strange.

Task: You must gain access to the password manager and decode the values within the password manager using CyberChef.
