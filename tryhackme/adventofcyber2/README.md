### DESCRIPTION

Get started with Cyber Security in 25 Days - Learn the basics by doing a new,
beginner friendly security challenge every day leading up to Christmas.

### THE CHRISTMAS STORY

After last year's shenanigans where Elf McElferson and Elf McSkidy were on damage control mode the entirety of December, McSkidy vowed to never let that happen again. The previous Christmas period was extremely stressful with the Christmas Monster managing to compromise every system within Santa's corporate infrastructure to prevent Christmas from happening. Is Christmas still in danger this year?

McSkidy showed great promise with the previous incident and was tasked with building up a security team within Santa's company - *The Best Festival Company*. Due to resistance from management, budgeting and bureaucracy issues, McSkidy was only able to start building out her team from the 8th November. Since then, she's only hired 2 team members - one security specialist Elf McHacker and one intern Elf McEager.

It's the evening of 30th November - McSkidy's team has been working hard to prevent any downtime and security incidents within the entire network and application stack of the Best Festival Company. McHacker suggested installing a VPN and only allowing access to the infrastructure via the VPN. After a long 8 hour installation and deployment, McSkidy opens her monitoring dashboard and notices that no traffic is flowing to any of the applications (this was expected as no one had access to the VPN). *thank god,* she said. *Getting hacked again is not an option.*

*RING, RING, RING* - her Elf hotline starts ringing and she jumps. *Santa's schedule isn't working - I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING,* yells Elf McAssistant. Within a matter of seconds, hundreds of phone calls come in and *Elf McSkidy gets that sinking feeling in her stomach.* She quickly dispatches *McHacker* to analyse the VPN logs. He notices a payload that resembles a VPN authentication bypass that allows anyone to bypass the VPN - *did someone install the wrong version.* With the poor state of security across the entire network, this unknown actor managed to access all applications and their underlying servers!

Unlike last time, no one has claimed responsibility for this incident. *Here we go again*, she sighs. It's up to you (Elf McEager) and the rest to save Christmas.

Please note, tasks are released daily and will vary in difficulty (although will always be aimed at a beginner level)
