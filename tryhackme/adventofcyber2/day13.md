Connect to this service to see if you can make use of it. You can connect to the service with the standard command-line client, named after the name of the service, or netcat. What credential was left for you?

```
$ telnet 10.10.102.162                                                                                     130 тип

Uh oh, looks like that perpetrator left a message! Follow his instructions to prove you really did leave Coal for Christmas!  After you leave behind the coal, you can `run tree | md5sum`. What is the MD5 hash output?

```
 su firefart
Password: 
firefart@christmas:/home/santa# cd /root
firefart@christmas:~# ls
christmas.sh  message_from_the_grinch.txt
firefart@christmas:~# cat message_from_the_grinch.txt
Nice work, Santa!

Wow, this house sure was DIRTY!
I think they deserve coal for Christmas, don't you?
So let's leave some coal under the Christmas `tree`!

Let's work together on this. Leave this text file here,
and leave the christmas.sh script here too...
but, create a file named `coal` in this directory!
Then, inside this directory, pipe the output
of the `tree` command into the `md5sum` command.

The output of that command (the hash itself) is
the flag you can submit to complete this task
for the Advent of Cyber!

        - Yours,
                John Hammond
                er, sorry, I mean, the Grinch

          - THE GRINCH, SERIOUSLY
