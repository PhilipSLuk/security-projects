# TRYHACKME: ADVENTOFCYBER2 [DAY 9] NETWORKING - Anyone can be Santa!

```
Even Santa has been having to adopt the "work from home" ethic in 2020. To help Santa out, Elf McSkidy and their team created a file server for The Best Festival Company (TBFC) that uses the FTP protocol. However, an attacker was able to hack this new server. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to understand how this hack occurred and to retrace the steps of the attacker.

Re-upload this script to contain malicious data (just like we did in section 9.6. Output the contents of /root/flag.txt!  Note that the script that we have uploaded may take a minute to return a connection. If it doesn't after a couple of minutes, double-check that you have set up a Netcat listener on the device that you are working from, and have provided the TryHackMe IP of the device that you are connecting from.

```
$ cat backup.sh       
#!/bin/bash

# Created by ElfMcEager to backup all of Santa's goodies!

# Create backups to include date DD/MM/YYYY
# filename="backup_`date +%d`_`date +%m`_`date +%Y`.tar.gz";

# Backup FTP folder and store in elfmceager's home directory
# tar -zcvf /home/elfmceager/$filename /opt/ftp
